      <h2 className="mb-6 text-6xl font-light uppercase tracking-widest text-accent">What drives me</h2>
      <p>I strive for more than simply going through the motions. It's difficult to motivate myself when
        what I'm doing isn't reinforced with some kind of meaning, a deeper interest or purpose. This is as true for 
        mundane activities like exercise and brushing teeth, as it is with my work.

      <h3 className="text-5xl font-thin uppercase tracking-widest text-accent">Creativity</h3>
      <p>The biggest inspiration of all is simply seeing other people be passionate and creative. 
        I've lost count of how many times I encountered other people's creative work and felt almost 
        obligated to match that passion for their craft. <br />
        Seeing the power within human creativity, the way it can bring together communities and make the world better 
        is one of the main reasons I still do the things I do.

      <h2 className="text-5xl font-thin uppercase tracking-widest text-accent">Music</h2>
      <p>A personal favorite of mine when it comes to art forms. I sing, play guitar and 
        produce my own music not just because I like the cool sounds I can make or because 
        some chord progressions sound pretty. It's another language. It's a different way 
        to express myself and process my life through it. <br />
        As a lover of all things audio I even made a bit of money as a freelancer doing various 
        audio editing.

      <h2 className="text-5xl font-thin uppercase tracking-widest text-accent">Programming</h2>
      <p>I was first interested in code some time at the end of highschool. It seemed kinda fun and 
        I didn't struggle with it as much as most other people so after some deliberation I went to get 
        a bachelor's in the field. Long story short I lost all motivation, started questioning if I even liked 
        coding to begin with or if I did it "just because". It took some time soul searching to realize that I 
        was way too in my own head about it all. Now, getting back into it I'm actually excited to code again. 
        I hope to jumpstart my programming path once again. This time with proper self direction. Making cool things 
        and contributing to open source projects.
