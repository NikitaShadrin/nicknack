## NickNack

This is a website made to practice my skills as a web developer. 
Built using Next.js, TypeScript, React and Tailwind

The home page acts as a simple "about me" while other tabs are individual small scale projects that focus on showcasing certain 
functionality.

1. Home
2. Updates
3. Endless Scroll
4. To Do

The updates have been moved to a tab on the site. README will be updated with relevant information soon
The last tab will soon be a collection of links to other projects.
This site does restrict me in some ways and I want to learn and experiment as much as possible.
