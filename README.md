This is a website made to practice writing code.

The home page acts as a simple portfolio while other tabs are individual small scale projects that focus on showcasing certain 
functionality such as endless scrolling or interactable animated elements

## Ver 1.05

*Functional* endless scroll with auto generating cards. I've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to achieve a smooth (horizontally ordered!) masonry layout.
Wondering if there are conflicting stylings I'm not noticing. I don't want to add a masonry layout dependancy but I might have to after all.
To do:
1) Animate the cards, add a hover effect
2) Avoid cards overlapping at certain screen resolutions
3) Actual masonry layout PLEASE

## Ver 1.1

I decided not to go for masonry after all. Settled on a simiple grid but I'm glad I explored all the other options though it wasn't very fruitful.
The cards no longer overlap and they bounce when clicked on for absolutely no reason. Incredible work, I have truly outdone myself.

Onto the next third tab (releasing next week) which should be a bit more exciting
