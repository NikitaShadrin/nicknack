This is a website made to practice writing code.

The home page acts as a simple portfolio while other tabs are individual small scale projects that focus on showcasing certain 
functionality such as endless scrolling or interactable animated elements

## Ver 1.05

*Functional* endless scroll with auto generating cards. I've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to achieve a smooth (horizontally ordered!) masonry layout.
Wondering if there are conflicting stylings I'm not noticing. I don't want to add a masonry layout dependancy but I might have to after all.
To do:
1) Animate the cards, add a hover effect
2) Avoid cards overlapping at certain screen resolutions
3) Actual masonry layout PLEASE

## Ver 1.1

I decided not to go for masonry after all. Settled on a simiple grid but I'm glad I explored all the other options though it wasn't very fruitful.
The cards no longer overlap and they bounce when clicked on for absolutely no reason. Incredible work, I have truly outdone myself.

Onto the next third tab which should be a bit more exciting.

## Ver 1.2

A basic little to do list that persists across sessions. Nothing extraordinary, though it's making me consider making a full blown app of my own...
I've been using the basic microsoft to-do and there's some things that annoy me about it so it might be worth it!
For now I'll stick to smaller projects though. The fourth tab will be an updates tab. I'm going to repurpose the README to actually talk about
the project and its technical aspects in more detail while the updates tab on the site itself will be a sort of informal changelog.
