*Functional* endless scroll with auto generating cards. I've wasted a lot of time trying to figure out how to achieve a smooth (horizontally ordered!) masonry layout.
Wondering if there are conflicting stylings I'm not noticing. I don't want to add a masonry layout dependancy but I might have to after all.
To do:
1) Animate the cards, add a hover effect
2) Avoid cards overlapping at certain screen resolutions
3) Actual masonry layout PLEASE
